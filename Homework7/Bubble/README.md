**Homework7, BubbleSort. By Emma Wilson**

This application is meant to random generate an array of numbers between 0 and 100. 
Then it will print the random array as is.
The next method called is the bubble sort, that will sort the integers in the array from smallest to largest.
Next the application will save the sorted array to a text file called, "Array.txt" and print the sort array from the text file.
