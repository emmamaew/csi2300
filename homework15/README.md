**Assignment 15**
In this app, I used JavaFX to develop a simple GUI for a 5x5 tic tac toe game.
There is a 5x5 board initialized using a 2D array and all elements are initial empty.
The game automatically will switch between player turns, and the player can click the cell in which they want to place their move.
Players are not allowed to select a cell that has already been taken.
For loop is used to check for a win after each player makes a move.
When checkWin() is true the appliaction will output who won the game. 
Player can win by getting 5 in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonal (left or right diagonal).
