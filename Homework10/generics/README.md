**Assignment 10, generics**
In this assignment I implimented a generic method for merge, mergeSort, and bubbleSort.
The file also contains an isSorted method which just determine if the array is sorted and a printArray that will print the array.
In the main method it sets an array to test. Then it prints the original array, sorts and prints the time in ns that it takes to sort.
Then it also prints the final sorted array. It will run this test for both bubble and merge sort.
